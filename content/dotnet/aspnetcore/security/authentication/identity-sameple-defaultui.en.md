ASP.NET Core Identity is our self-contained out-of-the-box solution. It includes:

- The **Identity Manager** that provides APIs for working with users (including claims and logins) and roles.
- **Identity Store** interfaces for persisting identity information (users, claims, login providers and roles).
- A default implementation of the identity store for relational databases. You have the option to create your own custom implementation of the identity store.
- An authentication system (**SignInManager**).
- A UI for user management (**Identity UI**).
